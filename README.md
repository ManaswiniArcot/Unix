# Unix
This repo contains a Unix project file.The project is to represent the data from a website in a tabular format without loosing any required information on the website. 

This involves grabbing the html source data and cleaning data,
by removing all the html tags and then formatting data. 

A small logic I followed in this project is, after cleaning all the html tags the raw data that is resulted from the process
is formatted
using a field separator,I added a FS in a each every line and then concatenated 
the lines into single line and separated a records
And then these records are presented in the 
tabular format.Each record is added as each row in the table.

You can find the complete Unix shell scripting files for this project.You can the final output in this url
